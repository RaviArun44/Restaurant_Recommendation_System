# 🍽️ Restaurant Recommendation System

A data-driven restaurant recommendation system built using the Yelp Open Dataset. It intelligently suggests restaurants to users based on preferences, reviews, and location insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages user reviews, restaurant metadata, ratings, and categories from the Yelp dataset to build a recommendation system that helps users discover popular and personalized dining options.

Designed as a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a recommender system.

## 💡 Highlights

- Content-based filtering using restaurant features (cuisine, location, price, etc.)
- Sentiment analysis of user reviews using NLP
- User preference modeling for personalized suggestions
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA
- Visualization of trends and review patterns

## 🗂️ Dataset

The project uses the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), which includes:

- `business.json` – Restaurant metadata
- `review.json` – User reviews and ratings
- `user.json` – User profile and behavior data
- `checkin.json`, `tip.json`, `photos.json` – Additional insights (optional)

## 🧰 Technologies Used
